Our study will include onlr even strength, 5 on 5 situations.

EV = Even Strength — i.e., hockey played with the same number of skaters on each side (no power play or penalty kill). 

Minutes filter: Require a minimum EV TOI per season (e.g., ≥ 500 EV minutes) to avoid noise.

Age definition: NHL standard is age on Feb 1 of the season. Compute integer age that way.

Outcome: Prefer score- & venue-adjusted 5v5 CF% (or at least raw 5v5 CF%). Also keep CF/60 and CA/60 as secondary outcomes.

Weights: Use EV minutes as analytical weights (seasons with more minutes are estimated more precisely).
